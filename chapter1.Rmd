# About the project

*Write a short description about the course and add a link to your github repository here. This is an R markdown (.Rmd) file so you can use R markdown syntax. See the 'Useful links' page in the mooc area (chapter 1) for instructions.*
This seems like a great course, although I don??t know yet whether I will have immediate use for the skills I learn here but hopefully in the future this will be useful. I??m also sure that learning about R and open data will make me a better researcher.
